As per Section 8(1a, 1b, 1c) of the new Companies Act, 2013, a Section 8 company can be established for If the NGO is intended to be in the form of an organization ‘for promoting commerce, art, science, sports, education, research, social welfare, religion, charity, protection of the environment or any such other object.
